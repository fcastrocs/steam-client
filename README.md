# Steam Client

A blazing fast Steam Client in Node.js with minimal overhead and clean, readable code.

Avoid using this library if you need a full-featured Steam Client. However, if you’re looking for a high-performance base to kickstart your own project and prefer TypeScript, this is a great choice. It’s designed to be easily extended with any unimplemented Steam protos.

Protocols supported: TCP and WS

Proxies supported: HTTP and Socks v5
